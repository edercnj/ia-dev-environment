# Skill: Epic Implementation Orchestrator

## When to Use

- Full epic implementation spanning multiple stories
- Multi-story orchestration with dependency-aware execution order
- Resumable epic execution after interruption
- Parallel story execution via worktrees

## Input Parsing

### Positional Argument (Required)

| Argument | Format | Required | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `EPIC-ID` | `XXXX` (4-digit zero-padded) | **Mandatory** | The epic identifier, e.g., `0042` |

The epic ID is a required positional argument. If missing, abort immediately:

```
ERROR: Epic ID is required. Usage: /x-dev-epic-implement [EPIC-ID] [flags]
```

### Optional Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--phase N` | number | (all phases) | Execute only phase N (0-3) |
| `--story XXXX-YYYY` | string | (all stories) | Execute only a specific story by ID |
| `--skip-review` | boolean | `false` | Skip review phases in x-dev-lifecycle subagents |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | `false` | Generate execution plan without executing |
| `--resume` | boolean | `false` | Continue from last checkpoint (execution-state.json) |
| `--parallel` | boolean | `false` | Enable parallel worktrees (default: sequential) |

## Prerequisites Check

Before execution, validate all prerequisites in order. Abort on first failure.

### 1. Epic Directory

Check that `docs/stories/epic-XXXX/` exists (where XXXX is the parsed epic ID).

```
ERROR: Directory docs/stories/epic-{epicId}/ not found. Run /x-story-epic-full first.
```

### 2. Epic File

Check that `EPIC-XXXX.md` exists in the epic directory.

```
ERROR: EPIC-{epicId}.md not found in docs/stories/epic-{epicId}/. Run /x-story-epic first.
```

### 3. Implementation Map

Check that `IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md` exists in the epic directory.

```
ERROR: IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md not found. Run /x-story-map first.
```

### 4. Story Files

Glob for `story-XXXX-*.md` files in the epic directory. At least one must exist.

```
ERROR: No story files found matching story-{epicId}-*.md.
```

### 5. Resume Checkpoint (conditional)

If `--resume` flag is set, check that `execution-state.json` exists in the epic directory.

```
ERROR: No checkpoint found (execution-state.json missing). Cannot resume. Run without --resume.
```

## Phase 0 — Preparation (Orchestrator — Inline)

1. **Parse arguments**: Extract epic ID from positional argument and all optional flags
2. **Run prerequisites checks**: Execute all 5 prerequisite validations (abort on first failure)
3. **Read IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md**: Extract the story dependency graph and execution order
4. **Read EPIC-XXXX.md**: Load epic context (title, description, acceptance criteria)
5. **Discover story files**: Glob `story-XXXX-*.md` to collect all story files in the epic directory
6. **Determine execution order**: Use the dependency graph from IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md to order stories; stories without dependencies can run in parallel if `--parallel` is set
7. **Create branch**: `git checkout -b feat/epic-{epicId}-implementation`
8. **Dry-run exit**: If `--dry-run` is set, output the execution plan (story order, dependencies, estimated phases) and stop
9. **Resume handling**: If `--resume` is set, read `execution-state.json` and skip already-completed stories
10. **Delegate**: For each story in execution order, invoke `/x-dev-lifecycle` with appropriate flags

## Phase 1 — Execution Loop

### 1.1 Initialize Execution State

1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md` content from the epic directory
2. Call `parseImplementationMap(content)` to obtain a `ParsedMap` containing:
   - `stories`: Map of story IDs to `DagNode` (with phase, dependencies, critical path flag)
   - `phases`: Map of phase numbers to story ID arrays
   - `criticalPath`: Ordered array of story IDs on the critical path
   - `totalPhases`: Number of execution phases
3. Build the stories array with `{ id, phase }` entries from the `ParsedMap`
4. Call `createCheckpoint(epicDir, input)` where input is:
   - `epicId`: The parsed epic ID
   - `branch`: `feat/epic-{epicId}-full-implementation`
   - `stories`: Array of `{ id, phase }` from step 3
   - `mode`: `{ parallel: false, skipReview: <from flags> }`
5. The returned `ExecutionState` tracks all story statuses, metrics, and integrity gates

### 1.2 Branch Management

1. Ensure a clean starting point:
   ```
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create the epic branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b feat/epic-{epicId}-full-implementation
   ```
3. If the branch already exists (resume scenario):
   ```
   git checkout feat/epic-{epicId}-full-implementation
   ```

### 1.3 Core Loop Algorithm

Execute stories phase-by-phase in dependency order:

```
For each phase in (0..totalPhases-1):
  1. Call getExecutableStories(parsedMap, executionState)
     → Returns stories sorted by critical path priority (RULE-007)
     → Only PENDING stories with all dependencies SUCCESS are returned
  2. If no executable stories and some remain PENDING:
     → Phase is blocked; log warning and advance to next phase
  3. For each executable story:
     a. updateStoryStatus(epicDir, storyId, { status: "IN_PROGRESS" })
     b. Dispatch subagent (see 1.4)
     c. Validate result (see 1.5)
     d. Update checkpoint (see 1.6)
  4. [Placeholder: integrity gate between phases — story-0005-0006]
  5. [Placeholder: progress reporting — story-0005-0013]
  6. Re-read checkpoint via readCheckpoint(epicDir) for next iteration
```

The loop ensures that:
- Stories are dispatched in dependency-safe order
- BLOCKED stories are never dispatched (filtered by `getExecutableStories`)
- Each phase completes before the next begins (sequential mode)
- [Placeholder: partial execution filter — story-0005-0009]

### 1.4 Subagent Dispatch (Sequential Mode)

For each executable story, launch a clean-context subagent using the `Agent` tool:

**Subagent Configuration:**
- Tool: `Agent` with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
- Context isolation (RULE-001): The orchestrator passes ONLY metadata to the subagent.
  Never pass source code, knowledge packs, or diffs. The subagent is born with
  clean context and dies after completion.

**Prompt Template for Subagent:**
```
You are implementing story {storyId} for epic {epicId}.

Story file: docs/stories/epic-{epicId}/story-{storyId}.md
Branch: {branchName}
Phase: {currentPhase}
Skip review: {skipReview}

Execute the x-dev-lifecycle workflow:
1. Read the story file for requirements
2. Create implementation plan
3. Implement following TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)
4. Run tests and verify coverage
5. Commit changes with Conventional Commits

Return a JSON result with this exact structure (SubagentResult):
{
  "status": "SUCCESS" | "FAILED" | "PARTIAL",
  "commitSha": "<git commit SHA if SUCCESS>",
  "findingsCount": <number of review findings>,
  "summary": "<brief description of what was done>"
}
```

- [Placeholder: parallel worktree dispatch — story-0005-0010]

### 1.5 Result Validation (RULE-008)

After receiving the subagent response, validate the `SubagentResult` contract:

1. **`status` field**: MUST be present, MUST be one of: `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `PARTIAL`
2. **`findingsCount` field**: MUST be present and be a number
3. **`summary` field**: MUST be present and be a string
4. **`commitSha` field**: If `status === "SUCCESS"`, MUST be present and be a string

**On validation failure:**
- Mark the story as FAILED
- Set summary to: `"Invalid subagent result: missing {field} field"`
- Continue to checkpoint update (1.6)

[Placeholder: retry with error context — story-0005-0007]

### 1.6 Checkpoint Update (RULE-002)

After each story completes (success or failure), persist the result:

1. Call `updateStoryStatus(epicDir, storyId, update)` where update contains:
   - `status`: The validated status (`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, or `PARTIAL`)
   - `commitSha`: The commit SHA (if status is `SUCCESS`)
   - `findingsCount`: Number of review findings from the subagent
   - `summary`: Brief description of what the subagent accomplished
2. Update metrics: increment `storiesCompleted` counter
3. The checkpoint is persisted atomically to `execution-state.json` via the checkpoint engine
4. Between story completions, the checkpoint always reflects the current execution state

### Integrity Gate (Between Phases)

After ALL stories in a phase complete, dispatch an integrity gate subagent before advancing to the next phase.

#### Gate Subagent Prompt

Launch a `general-purpose` subagent:

> You are an **Integrity Gate Validator** for {{PROJECT_NAME}}.
>
> **Step 1 — Compile:** Run `{{COMPILE_COMMAND}}` (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`).
> **Step 2 — Test:** Run `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` to execute the full test suite (not just current phase tests).
> **Step 3 — Coverage:** Run `{{COVERAGE_COMMAND}}` to collect coverage metrics.
> **Step 4 — Evaluate:**
> - If compilation fails → `{ status: "FAIL", testCount: 0, coverage: 0 }`
> - If any tests fail → correlate failed tests with commits from stories in the current phase
> - If line coverage < 95% or branch coverage < 90% → FAIL with coverage details
> - Otherwise → PASS
>
> Return: `{ status: "PASS"|"FAIL", testCount, coverage, branchCoverage?, failedTests?, regressionSource? }`

#### Regression Diagnosis

If tests fail, the subagent:
1. Analyzes which tests broke (`failedTests` array)
2. Correlates failed tests with commits from stories in the current phase (via `git log`)
3. Identifies the most likely story as regression source (`regressionSource`)
4. If identified: orchestrator executes `git revert <commitSha>` for that story
5. Story is marked FAILED with summary: `"Regression detected by integrity gate"`
6. Block propagation is executed for dependents of the failed story

#### Gate Result Registration

```
updateIntegrityGate(epicDir, phaseNumber, {
  status: "PASS" | "FAIL",
  testCount: number,
  coverage: number,        // line coverage %
  branchCoverage?: number, // branch coverage %
  failedTests?: string[],
  regressionSource?: string // story ID
});
```

- **PASS**: Advance to next phase
- **FAIL + regression identified**: revert + mark FAILED + block propagation
- **FAIL + regression unidentified**: pause execution, report to user

#### Gate Enforcement (RULE-004)

The integrity gate is **mandatory** — there is no bypass. Every phase transition requires a PASS gate
result. The gate runs after phase 0, 1, 2, and 3 — one gate per phase.

## Phase 2 — Consolidation

> **Placeholder**: This phase will be implemented in story-0005-0011.
> It will contain cross-story consolidation, branch merging, conflict
> resolution, and epic-level documentation generation.

## Phase 3 — Verification

> **Placeholder**: This phase will be implemented in story-0005-0011.
> It will contain epic-level verification, cross-story integration
> testing, final DoD checklist, and epic completion reporting.

## Integration Notes

- Invokes: `x-dev-lifecycle` (per-story execution), `x-story-map` (if map missing, via error guidance)
- All `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens are runtime markers filled by the AI agent from project configuration — they are NOT resolved during generation
