description: >
  Complete decomposition of a system specification into an Epic, individual Story files, and an
  Implementation Map with dependency graph and phased execution plan. This is the orchestrator
  skill that guides the full workflow: spec analysis, rule extraction, story identification,
  and implementation planning. Use this skill whenever the user asks to decompose a spec into
  stories and epic, break down a system document into implementable work items, generate a
  complete project backlog from a specification, create epic stories and implementation plan
  from a technical document, or any variation of "read this spec and create everything".
  Also trigger when the user wants the full decomposition pipeline — epic + stories + map —
  in a single pass, or mentions planning the complete implementation of a system from its
  specification. Prefer this skill over the individual x-story-epic, x-story-create, or
  x-story-map skills when the user wants all three deliverables.

# Complete Spec-to-Stories Decomposition

This skill orchestrates the full decomposition of a system specification into three
deliverables: an **Epic**, individual **Stories**, and an **Implementation Map**. It
coordinates the work of three focused skills, each handling one deliverable.

## The Three Deliverables

1. **Epic** — Scope, cross-cutting rules, quality gates, story index
2. **Stories** — One file per story with data contracts, Gherkin, diagrams, sub-tasks
3. **Implementation Map** — Phases, critical path, dependency graph, strategic analysis

## Prerequisites

Read these files before starting:

**Templates (output structure) — read all three:**
- `.claude/templates/_TEMPLATE-EPIC.md`
- `.claude/templates/_TEMPLATE-STORY.md`
- `.claude/templates/_TEMPLATE-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`

**Decomposition philosophy:**
- `references/decomposition-guide.md` (bundled with this skill)

If any template is missing, stop and tell the user.

## Decomposition Philosophy

Before generating anything, read `references/decomposition-guide.md`. It explains the
layer-by-layer approach that drives the entire decomposition:

- **Layer 0 (Foundation)**: Infrastructure — servers, schemas, APIs, protocol adapters
- **Layer 1 (Core Domain)**: The central operation establishing architectural patterns
- **Layer 2 (Extensions)**: Additional operations reusing core patterns
- **Layer 3 (Compositions)**: Stories combining multiple extension capabilities
- **Layer 4 (Cross-Cutting)**: Testing, observability, security, tech debt

The guide also covers:
- How to identify story boundaries (1 endpoint = 1 story, 1 protocol flow = 1 story)
- Dependency mapping (structural, data, pattern dependencies)
- Phase computation (DAG-based, parallel within phases)
- Sizing heuristics (too big, too small, just right)

## Complete Workflow

### Phase A: Analysis

1. Ask the user which spec file to process (or use the one they provided)
2. Read the entire spec file
3. Read `references/decomposition-guide.md`
4. Analyze the spec:
   - Identify cross-cutting rules (rules that span multiple journeys)
   - Identify stories by layer (foundation → core → extensions → compositions → cross-cutting)
   - Map dependencies between stories
   - Compute phases from the dependency DAG
   - Identify the critical path

### Phase B: Generate the Epic

Follow the instructions in `.claude/skills/x-story-epic/SKILL.md`:

- Extract rules → RULE-001..N table
- Build story index with titles and dependencies
- Define DoR/DoD from spec quality requirements
- Generate `EPIC-NNN.md` following `_TEMPLATE-EPIC.md`

### Phase C: Generate the Stories

Follow the instructions in `.claude/skills/x-story-create/SKILL.md`:

For each story in the Epic's index:
- Dependencies (Blocked By / Blocks) — must be symmetric
- Applicable rules (reference Epic rules by ID)
- User story description + technical context
- Data contracts (precise: field names, types, formats, derivation rules)
- Mermaid sequence diagrams (real component names from the spec)
- Gherkin acceptance criteria (happy path + errors + edge cases)
- Sub-tasks tagged `[Dev]`, `[Test]`, `[Doc]`

Generate files as `STORY-NNN.md` following `_TEMPLATE-STORY.md`.

### Phase D: Generate the Implementation Map

Follow the instructions in `.claude/skills/x-story-map/SKILL.md`:

- Dependency matrix (all stories, validated for consistency)
- Phase diagram (ASCII box-drawing)
- Critical path analysis
- Mermaid dependency graph (color-coded by phase)
- Phase summary and detail tables
- Strategic observations (bottleneck, leaves, parallelism, convergences, validation milestone)

Generate `IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md` following `_TEMPLATE-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`.

### Phase E: Save and Report

Save all files to the same directory as the input spec (or where the user specifies).

Report summary:
- Total rules extracted
- Total stories generated
- Total phases computed
- Critical path length (phases and stories)
- Maximum parallelism (largest phase)
- Main bottleneck (story blocking the most others)

## Language Rules

- All generated content must be in **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)**
- Technical terms in English stay in English (cache, timeout, handler, endpoint, etc.)
- Code identifiers, field names, enum values stay in English
- Gherkin in Portuguese: `Cenario`, `DADO`, `QUANDO`, `ENTÃO`, `E`, `MAS`
- IDs in English format: RULE-NNN, STORY-NNN, EPIC-NNN

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] Every rule in the Epic is referenced by at least one story
- [ ] Every story references at least one rule (except infrastructure stories)
- [ ] Dependencies are symmetric (A blocks B ↔ B blocked by A)
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Phase computation is correct (stories only enter phase when ALL deps are in earlier phases)
- [ ] Critical path is the actual longest chain (not just the deepest phase)
- [ ] Data contracts match the spec exactly (field names, types, formats)
- [ ] Each story has at least 4 Gherkin scenarios (happy + 2 errors + 1 edge case)
- [ ] Implementation map observations are specific, not generic
- [ ] All files follow their respective templates exactly
